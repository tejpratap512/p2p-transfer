## üñ•Ô∏è VPS Deployment

### Prerequisites

- VPS with minimum 1GB RAM (2GB+ recommended)
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later (other Linux distros should work but commands may differ)
- Node.js 14.x or later
- npm 6.x or later
- Git
- Nginx (optional, for reverse proxy)
- Domain name with SSL certificate (recommended for production)

### Step 1: System Preparation

```bash
# Update package lists
sudo apt update

# Install required system packages
sudo apt install -y curl git build-essential

# Install Node.js and npm
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs

# Verify installation
node --version
npm --version
```

### Step 2: Clone and Setup PeerSmash

```bash
# Create directory for the application
mkdir -p /var/www/peersmash
cd /var/www/peersmash

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/peersmash/peersmash.git .

# Install dependencies
npm install --production
```

### Step 3: Configure the Application

```bash
# Create environment configuration file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit configuration with your settings
nano .env
```

Important configuration options in .env:
```
PORT=3000                    # Application port
NODE_ENV=production          # Environment (development/production)
SIGNALING_PATH=/signal       # Path for WebSocket signaling
MAX_CONNECTIONS=100          # Maximum concurrent connections
SESSION_TIMEOUT=3600         # Session timeout in seconds
```

### Step 4: Setup Process Management (PM2)

```bash
# Install PM2 globally
sudo npm install -g pm2

# Start PeerSmash with PM2
pm2 start server.js --name "peersmash"

# Setup auto-restart on system reboot
pm2 startup
pm2 save

# Monitor the application
pm2 monit
```

### Step 5: Setup Nginx as Reverse Proxy (Recommended)

```bash
# Install Nginx
sudo apt install -y nginx

# Install Certbot for SSL
sudo apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

Create Nginx configuration file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/peersmash
```

Add the following configuration:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    # Redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    # SSL configuration
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/privkey.pem;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
    ssl_ciphers ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA512:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA512:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384;

    # Security headers
    add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
    add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload";

    # Static files cache
    location ~* \.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|ico|css|js)$ {
        root /var/www/peersmash/static;
        expires 30d;
    }

    # Forward requests to Node.js
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    # WebSocket signaling path
    location /signal {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

Enable the configuration and obtain SSL certificate:
```bash
# Enable site configuration
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/peersmash /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

# Verify Nginx configuration
sudo nginx -t

# Obtain SSL certificate
sudo certbot --nginx -d your-domain.com

# Restart Nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### Step 6: Firewall Configuration

```bash
# Allow SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw allow http
sudo ufw allow https

# Enable firewall
sudo ufw enable
```

### Step 7: Verify Deployment

1. Open your domain in a browser: `https://your-domain.com`
2. Verify that the PeerSmash application loads correctly
3. Test file transfers between two browser windows

## üöÄ Usage

### Starting a Transfer (Sender)

1. Open PeerSmash in your browser
2. Click "Send Files" to create a new transfer session
3. Share the generated session ID with the recipient
4. Wait for recipient to connect
5. Drag files onto the drop area or click to select files
6. Monitor transfer progress in the queue

### Receiving Files (Receiver)

1. Open PeerSmash in your browser
2. Click "Receive Files"
3. Enter the session ID provided by the sender
4. Wait for connection to establish
5. Files will automatically download as they are received
6. Click "Save" on completed files to download them

## üîß Technical Details

### Architecture

PeerSmash uses a hybrid architecture:
- **Signaling Server**: Facilitates initial connection between peers
- **WebRTC**: Handles the direct peer-to-peer data transfer
- **Client-side Processing**: All file handling and encryption occurs in the browser

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **WebRTC**: For peer connection and data channels
- **Socket.io**: For signaling between peers
- **Web Crypto API**: For file encryption/decryption
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Containerization**: Docker support for easy deployment

### File Transfer Protocol

Files are transferred in chunks (64KB by default) with the following workflow:
1. File metadata exchanged (name, size, type)
2. File divided into chunks
3. Each chunk transmitted with sequence information
4. Receiving browser reassembles chunks
5. Completion verification

## üîí Security

### Encryption Process

When encryption is enabled:
1. AES-GCM 256-bit key is generated client-side
2. File is encrypted in chunks before transmission
3. Encryption key is transmitted via secured data channel
4. Receiving browser decrypts data upon receipt

### Privacy Considerations

- **No Data Storage**: Files are never stored on our servers
- **No Logging**: Transfer content is not logged or monitored
- **Session Expiry**: Session IDs expire after completion
- **Client-side Processing**: All sensitive operations happen in your browser

## üåê Browser Compatibility

PeerSmash works on all modern browsers that support WebRTC:

| Browser | Minimum Version |
|---------|----------------|
| Chrome  | 72+            |
| Firefox | 65+            |
| Edge    | 79+            |
| Safari  | 12.1+          |
| Opera   | 62+            |

Mobile browsers are supported on:
- iOS Safari 12.1+
- Android Chrome 72+
- Samsung Internet 9.2+

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
